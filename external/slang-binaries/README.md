# slang-binaries

Binary dependencies for the Slang compiler.

## Premake

Slang and many of it's surrounding libraries use [premake](https://premake.github.io/). 

Prebuilt premake binaries are in the [premake](premake) directory. This also contains instructions on building 
premake for some targets.

## Lua Premake Modules

This repository also contains [modules](lua-modules) used by premake to create projects.
